| **Target users / stakeholders:**               | ***Primary users: Students***  · Profile: Students (ages 18-25) facing stress from academics, social life, or personal challenges.  ·Context : Many hesitate to use current counseling services, fearing stigma or lacking privacy. They need a support system that is private, anonymous, and available 24/7.  ***Secondary stakeholders:***  ·Profile : Key staff like the Principal, Hostel Wardens, and college counselors.  ·Role  **:**  They are not the end-users. They are the crucial partners for integrating the tool safely.  ·Interest  **:**  Their primary goal is student safety. They are essential for ensuring  a clear protocol for when a student is in crisis and needs real, human help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Planned activities for gathering insights:** | ***Stakeholder Interviews:***  We will conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including students, the Principal, hostel wardens, and on-campus counselors. The goal is to identify primary mental health "pain points," define critical privacy/ethical boundaries, and confirm the need for a safe "crisis handoff" protocol.  ***Literature &amp; Competitor Analysis (Completed):***  We have already analyzed existing solutions (like Wysa) and research papers. This helped us identify known ethical failures, such as "deceptive empathy" and the risk of user dependency, which our design will actively prevent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Problem Statement:**                         | Students in high-pressure academic environments (our current state) face significant mental health challenges but are often reluctant to seek help due to social stigma, lack of 24/7 availability, and privacy concerns.  While generic AI mental health chatbots exist, they are a flawed solution. They are not tailored to the specific context of college life (e.g., RVCE-specific stressors) and suffer from critical ethical issues, including data security risks, "deceptive empathy" designed to maximize engagement, and the potential to create unhealthy user dependency. These tools are also unreliable in a crisis and lack integration with human professionals.  This creates a  **gap:**  Students need a support tool that is not only accessible 24/7 but is  **fundamentally trustworthy, private, and context-aware.**  Our project aims to bridge this gap by creating an ethical AI-driven wellness companion (our desired future state). This tool will be designed to  **augment, not replace,**  human support. It will provide proactive, personalized support by correlating user-provided text with real-time wearable data, all while being guided by a personalized (RAG) knowledge base of the RVCE environment. It will be built on a "privacy-by-design" foundation and feature a clear crisis handoff protocol, ensuring students get the right level of help, right when they need it. |
